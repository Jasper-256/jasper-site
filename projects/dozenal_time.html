        <h2>Info:</h2>
        <p>Dozenal time is a version of 24 hour time that is meant to be easier to understand by people who are used to 12 hour time.</p>
        <p>The only difference from 24 hour time is that the hours are represented in dozenal (base twelve) instead of decimal (base ten).</p>
        <p>To read dozenal time, just use the first digit to determine AM or PM (0 is AM and 1 is PM), and the second digit to see the regular 12 hour time you are used to using.</p>
        <p>However, because dozanal has twelve digits we need to represent ten and eleven with their own digits; we use X for 10 because of Roman Numerals, and E for 11 because that is the first letter of eleven.</p>
        <p>Example: 1X:34 in dozenal time is 22:34 in 24 hour time and 10:34 PM in 12 hour time.</p>
