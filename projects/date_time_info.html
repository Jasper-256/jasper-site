        <h1>Date & Time Info</h1>
        <p>The first number shown here is the year from the Gregorian calendar after the start of the Common Era (CE).</p>
        <p>The second number is the day of the year starting with 000 on the first day of the year and going to 364 on regular years, or 365 on leap years.</p>
        <p>The time is just the standard 24 hour time in your local time zone taken from the system time on your device.</p>
        <p>The milliseconds on most devices are not completely accurate because most displays only refresh at 60hz which updates every 16.7ms which is much longer than 1ms.</p>
        <p>Some web browsers only update at 30hz or less to save power which only updates the time every 33.3ms.</p>
        <p>A high refresh 240hz display refreshes every 4.17ms, which is enough to make the 10ms digit fairly accurate.</p>
